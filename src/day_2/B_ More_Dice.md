# Day 2: More Dice

**Objective**
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. We recommend you review the previous challenge's Tutorial before attempting this problem.

**Task**
In a single toss of fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of .
1 / 9
1 / 6
2 / 3
5 / 6

**Solution**

A: rolled values are different
A': rolled values are the same
P(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - 6/36 = 30/36

B: sum is 6
P(B) = 5/36
P(A | B) = 4/5

P(A and B) = P(A | B) * P(B) = 4/5 * 5/36 = 4/36 = 1/9
