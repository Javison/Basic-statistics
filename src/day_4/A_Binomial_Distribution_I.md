# Day 4: Binomial Distribution I

**Objective**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution
In this challenge, we learn about binomial distributions. 

**Task**
The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is . If there is child born per birth, what proportion of Russian families with exactly children will have at least boys

Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. 
Then print your result, rounded to a scale of decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).

**Input Format**

A single line containing the following values:

1.09 1

If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

**Output Format**

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).
